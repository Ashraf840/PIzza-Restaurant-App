After cloning this django project to another machine:


01. Create a python environment in the working directory. It's better to user python version 3.9.6 for creating the environment. Activate the python environment.
		python3.9 -m venv env
		source env/bin/activate

02. Create a db instance into the new machine, using 'makemigrations'
		cd pizzaProj/
		python manage.py makemigrations
		python manage.py migrate

NB:
	Since a new db (db.sqlite3) is created, we need to create the superuser in order to use this project's django-admin-panel.
		python manage.py createsuperuser
	username: xyz
	email: xyz@gmail.com
	password: *******

03. Now activate the redis-server in another terminal tab.
	redis-server

04. Now run the django-server.
		python manage.py runserver 8080
